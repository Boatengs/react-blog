#My React Blog
<p>This Project basically is about a creating a blog using props
This project entails the usage of props; how familiar i am with it.with this project i knew that props are key parse values which or that are pollinated or transfered from parent(app) to the child(header etc etc).
I also realized that with React; there's no need to write in index html codes because it does that automatically,thus saves time..
In combination with .map I took an array of objects and displayed on JSX</p>
